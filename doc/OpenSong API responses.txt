	Notes
	- Slide is 'atomic' (i.e. multiple slides within a single item in slide editor that have been split by --- are 
	individual slides in the response).
	- Automatically inserted slides are also individual slides in the response.
	- Slide element in response does not contain slide content other than title and subtitle
	- Note that identifier seems to be identical to itemnumber in the response to "/presentation/status".
